# Freshmint

> The minty fresh way to launch an NFT project. :leaves: 

Freshmint is an all-in-one tool to deploy an NFT project on the Flow blockchain using Next.js and IPFS.

Here's what it gives you:

- A custom ready-to-deploy NFT contract.
- A simple command to mint NFT sets from CSV and image data.
- A pre-built app template for running a live NFT drop.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -g @onflow/freshmint

# start a new project
fresh start
```

After creating a new project, 
follow the instructions in your project README to get it up and running!

## Acknowledgments

Freshmint owes its existence to [minty](https://github.com/yusefnapora/minty),
an NFT minting tool for IPFS developed by [@yusefnapora](https://github.com/yusefnapora). 
Most of the core logic in fresh is borrowed from minty.
